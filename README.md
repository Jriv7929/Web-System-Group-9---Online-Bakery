<h1 align="center"> 🥐 FRESH PASTRIES BAKERY -  E-Commerce Website 🍰 </h1>

This project is a collaborative effort by a group of IT students from Mapúa Malayan Digital College, specializing in Web Systems and Technology. We developed a full-featured e-commerce website to apply our academic knowledge to a real-world business challenge, showcasing our ability to create practical, scalable, and elegant software solutions. The application's front end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a clean and intuitive user interface enhanced with custom images and icons. Core functionality includes a dynamic product catalog, a robust shopping cart system, and user authentication through a login modal. To improve the user experience, we also implemented features that allow users to easily filter and sort products. This academic project demonstrates our strong skills in front-end development and our capability to build a complete and professional-grade web system from scratch.
